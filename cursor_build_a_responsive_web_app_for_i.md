I'll create a Next.js web app for tracking weekly goals with a native iOS-like design that you can add to your iPhone home screen. Let me start by exploring the directory structure and then create the project.


Let me create the directory structure and set up the Next.js project:


Now let me create a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS:


Great! Now let me navigate to the project directory and install additional dependencies for MongoDB and PWA features:


Now let me install the types for MongoDB:


Perfect! Now let me explore the project structure and start building the app:


Great! Now let me start building the app. First, let me configure the PWA and update the Next.js config:


```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";
import withPWA from "next-pwa";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = withPWA({
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  pwa: {
    dest: "public",
    register: true,
    skipWaiting: true,
    disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
  },
  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ["mongoose"],
  },
});

export default nextConfig;
```

Let me check the current working directory and file structure:


Now let me create the project structure. First, let me update the Next.js config file:


```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
};

->

import type { NextConfig } from "next";
import withPWA from "next-pwa";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = withPWA({
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  pwa: {
    dest: "public",
    register: true,
    skipWaiting: true,
    disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
  },
  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ["mongoose"],
  },
});
```

Let me check the exact path:


Let me use the absolute path:


Now let me update the Next.js config:


Now let me create the PWA manifest file:


Now let me create the MongoDB connection utility:


Now let me create the Task model:


Now let me create the API routes. First, let me create the tasks API:


Now let me create the individual task API route for updating and deleting:


Let me create the directory first and then the file:


Now let me create the main layout with proper PWA meta tags:


Now let me create the main page component:


Now let me create the components directory and the WeekView component:


Now let me create the TaskList component:


Now let me create the AddTaskModal component:


Now let me install the date-fns library for date manipulation:


Now let me create the environment file template:


Let me fix that file:


Now let me create a README file with setup instructions:


Now let me create a vercel.json file for deployment configuration:


Now let me create some basic PWA icons. Let me create a simple script to generate placeholder icons:


Let me update the package.json to include proper scripts and metadata:


Let me update the package.json with better metadata and scripts:


Now let me test if the app builds correctly:


There seems to be an issue with the next.config.ts file. Let me check and fix it:


The config looks correct. Let me try a different approach and recreate the config file:


Now let me try building again:


There seems to be an issue with the next-pwa configuration. Let me try a simpler approach without PWA for now and get the basic app working:


Let me fix that file properly:


Let me use a different approach and create the file step by step:


Now let me check the file:


Perfect! Now let me try building the app:


Good! The build is working now, but there are some ESLint errors. Let me fix the config first and then address the code issues:


Now let me fix the code issues. First, let me fix the API route:


Now let me fix the individual task route:


Now let me fix the main page component:


Now let me fix the AddTaskModal component:


I notice there's an issue with the textarea in the AddTaskModal. Let me fix that:


Now let me try building the app again:


I need to fix the API route types for Next.js 15. Let me update the route:


Now let me try building again:


I need to fix the type mismatch. Let me update the AddTaskModal interface:


Now let me try building again:


I need to fix the MongoDB connection file. Let me update it:


Now let me try building again:

**User**

can we pick up this later, i have to run

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! We can definitely pick this up later. 

Here's a quick summary of what we've accomplished so far:

‚úÖ **Project Structure Created**
- Next.js 15 app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- MongoDB integration with Mongoose
- PWA-ready setup (though we simplified the config to avoid build issues)

‚úÖ **Core Components Built**
- Weekly calendar view with date navigation
- Task management (create, complete, move, delete)
- Add task modal with categories and priority flags
- Task list with iOS-like design
- API routes for CRUD operations

‚úÖ **Files Ready**
- All components and API routes are created
- MongoDB connection utility
- Environment configuration template
- README with setup instructions
- Vercel deployment config

**To continue later, you'll need to:**
1. Set up your MongoDB database and add the connection string to `.env.local`
2. Run `npm run build` to test the build
3. Optionally re-enable PWA features once we resolve the build issues

The app is designed to be fully responsive and work great on iPhone when added to the home screen. Take your time, and when you're ready to continue, just let me know!

Have a great time! üöÄ

**User**

alright, im back, can we continue where we left off?

---

**Cursor**

Welcome back! Absolutely, let's continue where we left off. We were just about to test the build after fixing the MongoDB connection types.

Let me try building the app now to see if we've resolved all the TypeScript issues:


Great! We're making progress. Now we just need to fix the TypeScript issue with the cached variable. Let me update the MongoDB connection file:


Now let me try building again:


I see the issue. Let me fix the MongoDB connection file with proper typing:


Now let me try building again:


Great! We're almost there. Now it's just an ESLint warning about using `const` instead of `let`. Let me fix that:


Now let me try building again:


Excellent! The TypeScript compilation is now working. The build is failing because it's trying to execute the API routes during build time and they need the MongoDB URI environment variable. This is expected behavior.

Let me create a `.env.local` file with a placeholder so the build can complete:


Now let me try building again:


üéâ **Excellent! The build is now successful!** 

The app has compiled successfully with just some minor warnings about metadata configuration (which don't affect functionality). Now let's test the development server to make sure everything works:


Perfect! The development server is now running. Let me also create a proper PWA manifest and add some basic icons to make the app ready for iPhone home screen installation.

First, let me create some basic PWA icons:


Great! I'm already in the right directory. Now let me create some basic PWA icons and update the manifest:


Now let me update the layout.tsx to fix the metadata warnings and improve the PWA setup:


Now let me create a proper deployment guide and update the README with current status:


Perfect! Now let me check if the dev server is running and test the app:


Let me check if the dev server is running and start it if needed:


The dev server isn't running. Let me start it:


Great! Now let me create a final summary of what we've accomplished and what you need to do next:
